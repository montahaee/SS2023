This is the latest update for the Groß Prog project, completed in May 2023. The program operates as a multithreaded process with three stages: reading input data, processing data, and writing output to a file. The output file will be located in the same directory as the input data. Input files should have the “.in” extension and the corresponding output files will have the “.out” extension if the input file is correctly formatted. Input files should be named “x.in” and output files “optimized_x.out”. If the input file is not readable, an error file with the “.err” extension will be generated. To run the program without an IDE, you can use the batch script located at “…/out/artifacts/softwareproduct_jar/” by entering the command “.\runjar.bat” for Windows or “./runjar.bat” for Unix systems. It is recommended to use IntelliJ as an IDE for editing the project. Dependencies include Oracle OpenJDK, JUnit 5.8.1, and JetBrains annotations.
